Need to fill this out once the project is complete. 
This will be some sort of a recipe website. It will be using HTML and different links. 
By the end I'm hoping to have a practical knowledge of HTML and links, and using those in combination with git. 


Website is complete. Made a home page and added 3 different recipe pages. Included images and linked everything together. Used both absolute and relative links
